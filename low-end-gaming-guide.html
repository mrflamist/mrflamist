		<center><h1>Running modern games on ancient hardware?</h1>

		Running ancient games on modern hardware is very easy. Just download an emulator or set up a 
		virtual machine and you're golden.<br> Running modern games on ancient hardware? Not so much. 
		Either it won't work at all, or it'll stutter so much, you'll be happy to<br> even see the 
		main menu. So what can you do? Buy a new PC! Easy enough! 
		<a href="https://yewtu.be/watch?v=TN25ghkfgQA&listen=1"><i>But is it really?</i><a><br>
		</p> <p>
		No. It isn't. There's currently a microchip shortage, scalpers are scalpier than ever and 
		COVID is still present. If new hardware is<br> not an option, we'll have to make do with what 
		we have... unless you're planning on selling your organs or family members.

		<h2><u><b>THE GUIDE:</b></u></h2>
		<p>
		This guide is mostly intented for systems running Windows 7 SP1 or later and will not work 
		for all games!<br>
		Whatever I tell you to do here should be safe, but <b>you should make backups</b> 
		regardless.<br><strong>I'm not responible for any damage you do to your installation/machine.</strong>
		</p>
		
		<h3><u>
		-Disable any unecessary startup software.
		</u></h3>
		<p>
		On Windows 7, press Win + R, type <b>msconfig</b>, press OK/Enter, switch to the <b>startup</b> tab, 
		disable everything that doesn't have <br> to be running on startup. Be careful with what you disable, 
		there could be drivers and such. If you're not sure, look it up.
		</p>
		
		<h3><u>
		-Keep all unnecessary software closed. Try looking for lighter alternatives to the software you need.
		</u></h3>
		<p>
		Third party clients can, for example, solve the electron mess the Discord is. It's against TOS though.
		<br> I can offer you some alternatives to Discord though!

		I myself use Discord on phone and if I have to use it on my laptop, I use it in the browser.<br>
		I am however using AIM and MSN Messenger when not using Discord. Together they use about 44 MB 
		of RAM.

		<h3><u>
		-Lower your game's settings or use retail version of the game.
		</u></h3>
		<p>
		The less stuff your game has to load, the less RAM it needs. Don't be scared of editing config 
		files. Just make a backup first.
		</p>
		
		<h3><u>
		-Disable visual effects.
		</u></h3>
		<p>
		Righ-click on <b>This Computer</b>, select <b>Properties</b>, then click on <b>Advanced system 
		settings</b> on the left panel, select<br> <b>Performance</b> and then disable the effects you 
		don't need. For maximum performance, select <b>Adjust for best performance</b>.
		</p>
		
		<h3><u>
		-Use only one Antivirus.
		</u></h3>
		<p>
		If you're clever enough, you don't even need one. However, Windows Defender should suffice.
		</p>
		
		<h3><u>
		-Defragment your hard drive regularly
		</u></h3>
		<p>
		If you're not on Windows XP, your system should be defraging automatically. It doesn't hurt to 
		check though. I recommend <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ultradefrag/">UltraDefrag</a>
		as it takes care of what Windows doesn't.
